#Doodle Jump Game
Doodle Jump is a popular Android and iPhone game. In the game, the aim is to guide a player up a never-ending series of platforms without falling. The left side of the playing field is connected with the right side. There is no definitive end to the game, but the end for each gameplay session happens when the player allows the player to fall to the bottom of the screen without hitting any platform.
